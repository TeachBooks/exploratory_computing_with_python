# Exploratory Computing with Python

This repository is on online interactive textbook created from a [TeachBooks Template](https://github.com/TeachBooks/template) and based almost entirely on material from the online resource <em>Exploratory computing with Python</em> by Mark Bakker ([repository](https://github.com/mbakker7/exploratory_computing_with_python), [website](https://mbakker7.github.io/exploratory_computing_with_python/)), which are provided under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). All modifications made on this website are also provided under a [CC-BY 4.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

The TeachBooks Template allows one to easily apply the [sphinx-thebe extension](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-thebe) to make the pages interactive: Python code can be written and executed directly in the browser without the need to install special software.

The material in this online book is an introduction to the Python programming language. Use of the sphinx-thebe extension means that users (learners) don't have to have Python installed on their personal computer to use and learn the language.
